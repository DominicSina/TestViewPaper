Task1
Implement the "Even Fibonacci numbers"-Problem.
(Hint the Fibonacci numbers are: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...)

a) Write a class with a method that generates all Fibonacci numbers below a certain number "collectFibBelow: aNumber". 

b) Additionally the class should have a method to sum up the even numbers in a collection.

c)  Write a method that combines a) and b) and sums up the Fibonacci numbers below a certain number.
\newpage
Task2
Implement the  "Sum Square Difference"-Problem

a) Write a method "sumSquaresOf: aCollection" that receives a collection of numbers, squares each number and sums up the squares.

b) Write a second method "squareSumOf: aCollection" that receives a collection of numbers, sums them up and returns the square of the sum.

c) Write a third method "sumSquareDiff: aCollection" that the difference between "squareSum: aCollection" and "sumSquareDiff: aCollection".
